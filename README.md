##  Key Findings
###  Short Contracts – Easy to Leave  
**Insight:** Most customers who left were on month-to-month contracts.  
**Recommendation:** Encourage longer contracts with discounts or bundles.

### New Customers Leave Early  
**Insight:** Customers with less than 10 months of service are leaving more.  
**Recommendation:** Give new customers extra support and check-ins early on.

### High-Paying Customers Leaving  
**Insight:** Customers paying over $80/month are leaving more than others.  
**Recommendation:** Offer loyalty rewards, discounts, and regular plan reviews to keep them happy.

### Fiber Optic Internet Issues  
**Insight:** Fiber users leave more often than others.  
**Recommendation:** Investigate service issues (speed, support, pricing) and gather feedback.

### Electronic Check Users  
**Insight:** Many customers who left used electronic checks.  
**Recommendation:** Engage them with smooth billing and helpful digital support.

###  Phone & Streaming Customers  
**Insight:** Customers with only phone or streaming services tend to leave.  
**Recommendation:** Improve service quality and offer bundles to increase value.

## Project Steps (Using Power BI)

Here’s a breakdown of how I completed this customer churn and membership prediction project using Power BI:

### 1. Data Collection
- Imported the dataset (CSV/Excel format).
- Explored columns such as contract type, tenure, charges, internet service, and payment method etc.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed missing values and duplicates using Power BI Power Query Editor.
- Converted data types (e.g., dates, numbers, categories).
- Created new columns (e.g., , tenure, Charge categories) for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Built visuals to explore churn patterns:
  - **Donut chart** for churn by contract type, internet service, payment method, contract.
  - **Line and stacked column chart** for tenure, monthly charges and service type.
 
### 4. Key Insight Identification
- Analyzed the visual patterns to extract key churn drivers.
- Focused on behavior by tenure, monthly charges, service type, and contract length.

### 5. Business Recommendations
- Documented findings and provided actionable suggestions for retention and membership campaign targeting.

### 6.  Dashboard Finalization
- Designed a clean, interactive dashboard layout in Power BI.
- Included filters and slicers for better user experience.

### 7. Export & Share
- Exported dashboard as images and integrated them into this GitHub repository.
